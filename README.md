# Oculomotor_Pipelines
 Contains the matlab code used to process behavior and neural data from Primate experiment with read & write probe
 behavior pipeline can be used to process behavior data, specifically eye position data 
 Neural pipeline can be used to process neural data recoded by NP10 read&write probe 
 Neural Data Analysis is the code used to analyze the neural data after spike sorting together with the previous behavior data

## Behavior Pipeline

### **artifact_filter.m** 
MATLAB code for 

## Neural Pipeline

### Usage Instructions
1. First run ***get_matching_intan_blackrock.m***. the code will generate a sorted intan folder where each intan file sorted and copied to a folder named after the corresponding blackrock files. 

2. Then run ***All_Intan2Bin.m***
> The code will first prompt for the 

**root folder for sorted intan files:**
> This is the root folder for all the sorted intan files from previous steps. 
then the code would prompt for 

**select folder to store the output:**
> This folder is used to store the output of the code: including **session trigger files** (which is used in later steps), **channel mapping schemetic** (red for stim channels and green for the others), and the ***.bin*** file for all the intan files.
The code will then prompt 

**name session .bin file:**
> This ask for an arbitrary name for the .bin file. The default is **all_files_**.

3. The ***.bin*** file is then used for spike sorting using ***kilosort4***. 

4. The kilosort result needs to be manually curated in phy gui with 
phy template-gui params.py
be sure to mark all the "good" clusters green This is **important** for running the code ***KiloSort2Stitch_KS4_NStruct.m***

5. After manually curating the spike sort result, pass it into ***KiloSort2Stitch_KS4_NStruct.m*** to stitch it back to the ***_neural.mat*** file for further analysis. 
***KiloSort2Stitch_KS4_NStruct.m*** will first prompt 
choose root folder for _neural.mat files to stitch kilosort 4 result
for the folder for the _neural.mat files that is previously generated and calibrated from intan files 

**select folder for session trigger files:**

> this ask for folder for session trigger files generated in step 2

**select folder for kilosort4 results files:**

> this ask for the folder for the kilosort4 results. 

**select output folder:**

> prompt for the folder to store the _neural.mat files with unit activity (ua) and firing rate estimate (fr). 

### Code Specifics
#### **All_Intan2Bin.m**
Adapt the approach of concatenating all Intan recordings from multiple stimulation trials into a single ***.bin*** file for spike sorting using **Kilosort4**. The default channel map setting, ImecPrimateStimRec128_kilosortChanMap.mat, contains the coordinates (in µm) of the **128** channels on the **Neuropixel read &write probe**. The mapping of Neuropixel channel arrangement to the numbering in Intan files is predefined in the code as ***neuropixel_index***. Additionally, the code utilizes ***artifact_Removal.m*** to eliminate artifacts in the recordings caused by stimulation onset. The parameters for artifact removal can be fine-tuned for each specific session using the scripts in filter test.
